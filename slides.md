# Leviticus 10:8--11
“And the <sc>Lord</sc> spoke to Aaron saying... ‘You shall distinguish between the holy and the profane, and between the impure and the pure, and you shall teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the <sc>Lord</sc> spoke to them through Moses.’”

<!--
* Lev 10 describes a fundamental duty of the priests: to distinguish and to teach.
* The priests are responsible for maintaining boundaries around the presence of the Lord and around the people and the land.
    * This involves separating the holy and profane and the pure and the impure.
    * Many English translations use the terms "clean"/"unclean" which obscures what's actually going on. 
        * The issue isn't cleanliness, but impurity.
        * This is a metaphysical contagion that goes beyond the presence or absence of dirt or other physical contaminants.

# Leviticus 15:31
“\[The <sc>Lord</sc> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,\] ‘Thus shall you keep the people of Israel separate from their impurity, lest they die in their impurity by defiling my tabernacle that is in their midst.’”

<!--
* The significance of purity law is not a a matter of cleanliness or of simple piety.
* Rather, the continued cohabitation of God with the nation is at stake.
* The defiling of the tabernacle threatens the integrity of the Sinai covenant.

# Ezekiel 22:26 
“\[The land’s\] priests have done violence to my instruction and have profaned my holy things; they have not distinguished between the holy and the profane, and they have not taught the difference between the impure and the pure, and they have disregarded my sabbaths, so that I am profaned in their midst.”

# Ezekiel 44:23
“And \[the priests\] shall teach my people to know the difference between the holy and the profane, and the difference between the impure and the pure.”

<!--
* This priestly duty comes up in Ezekiel 22:26 and Ezekiel 44:23.
* Ezekiel 22 describes the failure of the priests to properly teach/distinguish; this leads to the profanation of God himself.
* Ezekiel 44 describes a vision of a renewed temple where the priests carry out their duty appropriately.

<!--
* Is there an impurity-holiness continuum?
* Jay Sklar portrays ritual status in this way, although the words "continuum" or "spectrum" are not used (see Jay Sklar, Leviticus: An Introduction and Commentary, TOTC 3 (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 2014), 44--49).
* In this schema, consecration moves the subject from purity to holiness, while profanation does the opposite.
* Likewise, defilement and purification allow movement between purity and impurity.
* The issue here is that this framing does not account for the possibility of the defilement of a holy item.
    * To wit, the altar does not cease to be holy when it is defiled by moral impurity.
    * Likewise, a priest does not cease to be holy when he is defiled by bodily impurity.
    * Indeed, it is the continued holiness of the subject that demands elimination of impurity.
* It seems better to understand holiness as a divinely-ordained state that persists even if the subject undergoes defilement.

# ritual impurity

<!--
* Violations of the boundaries between holy/profane and impure/pure are described using the language of "defilement."
* This language occurs in different contexts and describes different actions and states.
* When we survey these different contexts, we find that there are two types of impurity that Leviticus descibes: ritual impurity and moral impurity.

# Leviticus 12:2--7 (NRSV)
“If a woman conceives and bears a male child, she shall be impure seven days; as at the time of her menstruation, she shall be impure\.\.\.\. Her time of blood purification shall be thirty-three days; she shall not touch any holy thing, or come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification are completed\.\.\.\. When the days of her purification are completed... she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb in its first year for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a turtledove for a \[purification\] offering. He shall offer it before the <sc>Lord</sc>, and \[effect expiation/purgation\] on her behalf; then she shall be purified from her flow of blood.”

# Leviticus 15:2--15
“When any man has a discharge from his member, his discharge makes him impure\.\.\.\. Every bed on which the one with the discharge lies shall be impure; and everything on which he sits shall be impure. Anyone who \[touches the man or various objects he has touched\] shall wash \[their\] clothes, and bathe in water, and be impure until the evening\.\.\.\. When the one with a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, he shall count seven days for his purification; he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in fresh water, and he shall be purified. On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons and come before the <sc>Lord</sc> to the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest. The priest shall offer them, one for a \[purification\] offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall \[effect expiation/purgation\] on his behalf before the <sc>Lord</sc> for his discharge.”

# Numbers 19:11--15
“Those who touch the dead body of any human being shall be impure seven days. They shall purify themselves with \[the water of purification\] on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be pure; but if they do not purify themselves on the third day and on the seventh day, they will not become pure. All who touch a corpse, the body of a human being who has died, and do not purify themselves, defile the tabernacle of the <sc>Lord</sc>; such persons shall be cut off from Israel. Since water for purification was not dashed on them, they remain impure; their impurity is still on them. This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be impure seven days. And every open vessel with no cover fastened on it is impure.”

# Ritual impurity
1. Unavoidable, sometimes natural, and part of everyday life.
2. Can be contracted from objects or substances.
3. Can be transmitted to others directly and indirectly.
4. Removed by time, ritual washing, and sometimes sacrifice.
5. ***Not*** sinful! It is not a sin to become ritually impure.

<br/>

# Moral impurity
1. Avoidable.
2. Caused by grave sin, but cannot be spread through social contagion.
3. Pollutes the land of Israel.
4. Typically can be removed via atonement or punishment, but sometimes irremovable.
5. ***Absolutely*** sinful.
